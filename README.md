# libc-bionic
This repository contains scripts to build bionic libc (used in Android) only.

I was unable to find any documentation to build just bionic, which gave rise to this.

Please install *build-essential* (Ubuntu) or *base-devel*(Arch Linux), as well as *git* tool.

Tested on **Linux-6.9.7-zen1-1-zen-x86_64-Arch-Linux**, AOSP version **android-14.0.0_r9**.
